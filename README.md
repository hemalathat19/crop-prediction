Crop Prediction System

Overview

The Crop Prediction System uses machine learning techniques to predict the best crops to grow based on various factors such as soil conditions, weather patterns, historical data, and more. The goal of the project is to assist farmers in making data-driven decisions that can improve crop yield, reduce risk, and optimize resource utilization.

Features

Predict Crop Yield: Predict which crops are likely to yield the highest in a given region based on environmental factors.

Data Analysis: Analyze various environmental and historical data to make accurate predictions.

Machine Learning Models: Implement different machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Linear Regression for prediction tasks.

Visualization: Use data visualization tools to display insights, crop performance, and prediction results.
